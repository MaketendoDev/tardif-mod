Whole worlds pivot on acts of imagination.
You know what that’s called? Being alive.
There’s no point in being grown up if you can’t be childish sometimes.
There’s always something to look at if you open your eyes!
Life depends on change, and renewal.
Nothing’s sad until it’s over, and then everything is.
’re in a library! The best weapons in the world!
We’re all stories, in the end.
Just make it a good one, eh?
I’ve never met anyone who wasn’t important
Where I stand is where I fall.
Who I am is where I stand.
Bowties are cool!
It's bigger on the inside!
