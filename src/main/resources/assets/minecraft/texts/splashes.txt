That's why I keep moving on, to see the next thing, and the next, and the next. And sometimes... It looks even better through your eyes.
Whole worlds pivot on acts of imagination.
Letting it get to you. You know what that’s called? Being alive.
There’s no point in being grown up if you can’t be childish sometimes.
There’s always something to look at if you open your eyes!
Life depends on change, and renewal.
Nothing’s sad until it’s over, and then everything is.
You want weapons? We’re in a library! The best weapons in the world!
We’re all stories, in the end. Just make it a good one, eh?
Sometimes, the only choices you have are bad ones, but you still have to choose.
In 900 years of time and space, I’ve never met anyone who wasn’t important
Who I am is where I stand. Where I stand is where I fall.
Bowties are cool!
It's bigger on the inside!
